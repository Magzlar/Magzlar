ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ryan, a Neuroscience and Pharmacology graduate with a Ph.D. in Health and Medicine.

ðŸ§ª My Ph.D. focused on researching the potential of phytocannabinoids in stroke-related injuries. Afterward, I worked as an Associate Scientist at a pre-clinical contract research organization, using radioisotopes to assess ligand-receptor interactions. Following this I was a Senior R&D Associate at a nature-inspired drug-discovery company. I led the research and development for an early-stage drug-discovery program, where I was involved in identifying promising <i>in silco<\i> molecules based on their physicochemical properties, designing pre-clinical experiments and performing commericial analysis. I also performed assessments for disease areas and competitors.

ðŸ’» I enjoy using Python to streamline data extraction, cleaning, and analysis, as well as creating effective visualizations. I'm also interested in exploring Python's applications for IoT. Take a look at some [examples](https://github.com/Magzlar/Examples) of my work!
