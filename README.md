ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ryan, a Neuroscience and Pharmacology graduate with a Ph.D. in Health and Medicine.

ðŸ§ª My Ph.D. focused on researching the potential of phytocannabinoids in stroke-related injuries. Afterward, I worked as an Associate Scientist in a pre-clinical contract research organization, studying ligand-receptor interactions.

ðŸ“Š In my most recent role as a Senior R&D Associate at a nature-inspired drug-discovery company. I led the research and development of early-stage drug-discovery programs, identifying promising drug candidates and designing pre-clinical experiments. I also performed assessments for disease areas and competitors.

ðŸ’» I enjoy using Python to streamline data extraction, cleaning, and analysis, as well as creating effective visualizations. I'm also interested in exploring Python's applications for IoT. Take a look at some [examples](https://github.com/Magzlar/Examples) of my work!
