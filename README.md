PhD neuroscience grad with expertise in drug discovery from bench to bedside, and a passion for using Python to aid in drug discovery, and also to make cool stuff.

My Ph.D. focused on researching the potential of phytocannabinoids in pre-clinical models of stroke. Afterwards I worked as an Associate Scientist at a pre-clinical contract research organization, using radioisotopes to assess ligand-receptor interactions. Following this I was a Senior R&D Associate at a nature-inspired drug-discovery company, where I led the R&D for an early-stage drug-discovery program. This invlved assessing <i>in silco</i> molecules, designing pre-clinical experiments and performing commericial analysis.

I am now a healthcare analyst at Global Data, where I provide competitive intelligence to big pharma through research and data analysis. 

ðŸ’» I enjoy using Python to streamline data extraction, cleaning, and analysis, as well as creating effective visualizations. I'm also interested in exploring Python's applications for IoT. Take a look at some [examples](https://github.com/Magzlar/Examples) of my work!
