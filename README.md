PhD neuroscience grad with expertise in drug discovery from bench to bedside, and a passion for using Python to aid in drug discovery, automate workflows and make cool stuff.

My Ph.D. focused on researching the potential of phytocannabinoids in pre-clinical models of stroke. I have worked as a Senior R&D Associate at a nature-inspired drug-discovery company, where I led the R&D for an early-stage drug-discovery program. This ivolved assessing <i>in silco</i> molecules, designing pre-clinical experiments and performing commericial analysis. I am now a analyst/automation developer at Global Data, where I provide competitive intelligence to big pharma through data analysis and automating internal workflows 

I'm also interested in exploring Python's applications for IoT. Take a look at some [examples](https://github.com/Magzlar/Examples) of my work!
